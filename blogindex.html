            Web design is the process of planning, conceptualizing, and arranging content online.
            Today, designing a website goes beyond aesthetics to include the website’s overall functionality.
            Web design also includes web apps, mobile apps, and user interface design.<br><br>
            There are two main ways to design a website: using a desktop app or using a website builder.
            The tool you decide to use will vary greatly based on your team size, your budget, and the type of site you wish to build and its technical requirements.<br><br>
            When designing a website it’s important to consider both the site’s appearance and functionality. Integrating these elements will maximize the site’s overall usability and performance.
            Your site’s usability includes elements such as an easy-to-navigate interface, appropriate use of graphics and images, well-written and well-placed text, and a color scheme.
            Your site’s performance refers to its speed, ranking, searchability, and ability to capture your audience.

            Simply put, esports are the competitive wing of multiplayer gaming. But there’s a wide range of ways, places and games to play.<br><br>
            Large-scale esports tournaments are happening all the time on the Internet with players competing from home. <br><br>Platforms such as Faceit, Battlefy and World Gaming Network allow users to join matchups as independent players or go in as teams.
            Although many gamers play just for the thrill, online tournaments frequently award cash prizes.<br><br> If teens are part of an esports team at school, the games are played using the school’s Internet link, and there is no traveling — except for,
            possibly, playoff games and state championships.<br><br> A growing number of colleges also offer esports as varsity-level sports. Then there’s the live, professional circuit, where players compete in venues that accommodate hundreds — if not thousands — of fans.
            Pro games are broadcast on video channels, including YouTube Gaming and Twitch, and are televised on channels including ESPN and DisneyXD.
